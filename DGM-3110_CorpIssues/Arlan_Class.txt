Arlan: Legal stuffs in 3D graphics and Animation
----------------------------
THere is no such thing as asking for too much money
There is no such thing as making too much money
As long as the people giving you the money are happy there is no such thing as too much
Dont get stuck with the idea that you need to do exactly what you need to do dream wise making money is really good or better than dreams in some cases
money does not buy happiness but the lack of money does buy you misery

When you apply for a job you give the employer a resume. There are several to thousands given to them. 
Hiring is easy firing is hard
Every buying decition is based first on emotion and later is justified with information
Your cover letter needs color and formatting this will strike your resume as fun to read and interesting
emotion gets you hired
cover letter gets you to interview
Change the job by adding personal info to the interview
Think of the pain that a company may have and see how you can relieve that pain. If they need something be the person they need
Treat the staff like gold
The admins are the ones who keep the company running
say things like id love to join the team. not the company
become friends with the admin and get names for who hires then like kinda stock them
Then figure out what pains them and become the person who solves that porblem
find commonalities with the hiring people

the more full instruction on cover letters by arlen is on u da me which he will give me full access 

careercatalyst on udame on the side there is text that says use cupon code then enter the code
careercatalystfree all lower if not then 

adapt the style that teachers present so that you can transfer it all out

Cover letter is a page and a half
make it look like letter head

put your contact info center at the top
who ton is the next block left justified
To: name role comapny
From: 
Date: xyz
Re: postion that you posted for
do not use to whom it may concer. always use there name in the process of making a cover letter
next is Dear person person person
Next to the To from block is a color photo
put your name in small caps at the top
right under your name put a catch phrase if youd like
ie consulting and creative in arlans case
After the dear portion you use I only once in saying I am applying for this job etc
then in quotes "I jsut want you to know that with me on your team, you get: "
after this go to bullet points 4 or more if you can
pain point is where they can get more money
next is their personal things like less stress and hassle
less "churn" or turnover churn is the bussiness bussiness term for people who know bussiness stuff :p
these points are not prefab things
more free time or, "more time to hike golf or spend with your family"
^^^ this should be things you know they like. if you find soemthing general put that first then second is something you know they exactly like
These four points are the real mull over things what no one else writes

After this draw a call out box then put a light color shade in it at the bottom
grey toupe or tan
color thumbnail of the perosn who gives a testimonial 
"testimonial" name role comapny
do this two more times on the next page
put your best one of these guys first

sorry back after the bullet points put this sentence "Look at just a few of my former managers (or bosses- note this dimishes you) and colleges have to say about working with me."
format for bullet points we use two point bullet points 
bullets wound. Bullet points are an itch that you are waiting to be scratched
problem agitate solve, that is what you do with the bullet pointseach bullet fllows the after dear sentence
do not ever talk about you
dash dash becomes a long dash 

what you get -- how you solve it or a reason to belive you
I just want you to know that with me on your team you get: * a profit boost -- I am experianced and effective in possitive client realtions

The only time you use I is in the back end of the double bullet

After the images and people use a call to action ie. please call me immediatly at xyz for an interview

the magic phrase: I am activly seeking employment [in my field], so I have my resume (with accents) out to a number of different firms.

word this next part so that it is not disenjenous

Working with you is on my deffinate short list, so please CALL ME ASAP for an interview before I [have to] commit somewhere else.
dont sound desperate at any point in the hiring process

next sincerely, (in dark blue) put your signature and then your name on the nxt line

P.S. (your best bullet reitterated) 
^^ 2 is probably best
nothing on the cover letter is on your resume
