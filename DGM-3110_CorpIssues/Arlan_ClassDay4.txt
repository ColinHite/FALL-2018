Arlan's Class Day4 - Litigation Still?
------------------------
David Kahl

Putting on evidence

There are three levels of appeal on an audit 

District court of appeals

US supreme court

the evidence has to be admissable to court
There are rules for this kind of thing

there are the federal rules of addmitiance and use

hearsay - hearsay is an out of court staement used to prove its own truth

hearsay is not admissable in court

the audio track on video is useless in court
Audio at all is an out of court staement

emails are good, signed paper is probably best

pop 3 accounts are not good

there are hearsay exceptions
excited utterance anything people blert out at a scene - so shut it!!!
dying decloration - when you die and say something at the same time
deffimation/slander
bussiness records kept in the regular course of business - ie notes on phonecalls

you want to get your business used to keeping records

aquiencence on both sides is also something that should happen - ie after a call email the person with notes about the call and ask if its alright
otherwise an error in court is also something that can be used in an appeal

on appeal they will either send it back for a redecition or a new trial
there is no fairness in an appeal case

ADR alternative dispute resolution - mediation: a referied diolouge, the mediators job is to level the room. So essentially this is when the domonent aspect of a relationship is leveled
Arbitration: a trial like proceding in which a former judge or senior jusdge arbitrates a solution with every peice of evidence that hey have including hearsay

The rules of evidence are a protection
child care pay is statutory

in mediation the most payout happens because there is no neaky lawyer stuff happening

in order to enter things into court you need to. 
So to do an eyewitness you have to ask the jusdge then have them sworn in, then you have to ask them who they are and have them respond. 
The trial is all about posture and making it look good for yourself
you can olny do one wuestion at a time and you have to lay foundation
everything has to come from a witness including facts on documents
you have to stand in court to say anthing
never tell a witness what to say its a felony and really bad stuff to do
be really good on who you hire

secret: if you are hiring for customer service send them a bad voice message on purpose so that you can screen for rude people.
always screen for things when doing anything with anyone else
keep the paper copy for 7 years
2-3 years on somethings
7 years on some money things
tenant gets favor
in comercial properties its kinda even
fesimple absolute: I own the property and no one has any ownership of the property. enjoyment possestion and control
EULA's are like a bandage with adhession
