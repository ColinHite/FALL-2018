Arlen's Class
-----------------------
Contracts
In this class all you want to see are the things wrong with a contract
STooooupid people are people who sign bad contracts not knowing whats going on. 

Intellectual property
Tradmark starts when you pay
duration of copyright life plus 70 for a natural person
for an entity its different 90 years from registration or 120 years from creation which ever is shorter

Vauge, Unfair, Contradiction, ommistion

in the example the first line is a problem because it can be infurred that the consideration has been recived at the time of reciving the contract
The first blue callout intends that all prior work is subject to the contract
Oral work orders are really not cool and is a problem
In this contract the work order and the specifications contradict each other because they define the work in different places
ALso there is a problem where best efforts can describe doing everything in your power. So the fair term is commercially reasonable efforts
Prov 2. 
The blue in the contract bassically implies that they can play semantics about each thing
^The biggest things were context form style and other. Ie the other party can reject something because they did not define it in the work order
^^who is the third party?
Prov 3
The problem with the blue is that it implies the publisher can do anything with the end result and make you do a lot more work for no extra pay.
^Best efforts is unfair
Prov 4
There is a big problem with prov 4. 
Essentially the first block suggests that they can use your material for anything they want and make money off of it forever
Similarly it implies that they have access to all your previous work as well.

including, but not limited to,
Includin, without limitation, --this is very vauge
Prov 5
This section is really bad because they are bassically saying that if they put it in print then you cant do anything with it for 3 months
Similarly, it bassically menas if they dont print youll never make money on it
prov 6
they bassically say that anything you do while oing a work order then they own it too
prov 8
if the photos get leaked anywhere you dont get any money and they still get the phtots that you make
prov 9
bassically means they can do anything with your photos
prov 10
if they cancel the shoot you will not get more than 50% ever which doesnt include costs 
prov 11
there is no way to define things like obsene and offencive

First right of refusal is rally bad. Never sign these because it forces you to go through someone
